I see the issue. There's a syntax error in the dashboard page with malformed JSX in the user name display. Let me fix this.

Perfect! I've fixed the syntax error in the dashboard page. The malformed JSX with the broken string concatenation has been replaced with a clean, simple name display. The dashboard should now load properly without any syntax errors.

Perfect! I've updated the dashboard to show "Adeeba Maryam" as the user name throughout the interface and changed the college from UCE to MJCET (Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology). The changes include:

Profile name: Now shows "Adeeba Maryam"
Welcome message: Now says "Adaab, Adeeba!"
College badge: Now shows "MJCET Class of 2018"
Avatar initials: Changed from "JD" to "AM"
The dashboard now properly reflects Adeeba Maryam as an MJCET alumna from the class of 2018.
